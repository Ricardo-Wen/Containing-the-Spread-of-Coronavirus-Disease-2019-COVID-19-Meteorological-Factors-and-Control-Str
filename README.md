# Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies 
This repository is one of the supplementary materials for the article named "Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies". 
In this repository, we uploaded the collected disease datasets, regression datasets and the code of the extended SEIR model. 
For 21 provinces in Mainland China (Anhui, Chongqing, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang), Hongkong, China, Macau, China, Taiwan, China, and Singapore, we browsed all reports published on official websites of local health commissions, and extracted key epidemiologic information, such as travel history (whether imported patient, departure date and return date), date of infected, symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, confirmation date, and isolation date. 
We also obtained the doubling time of confirmed cases in the 69 countries outside China with no less than 180 cases by 25 March 2020.
The code of extended SEIR model is used to estimate the transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers at the beginning of the outbreak in China, in the later stages of the 11 provinces (Anhui, Chongqing, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shandong, Tianjin, Yunnan) in Mainland China and in Hong Kong, China.
To study the impact of meteorological factors (temperature and relative humidity), we uploaded two datasets to regress the situation of China and other countries respectively.
