# Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies 
This repository is one of the supplementary materials for the article named "Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies" 
In this repository, we uploaded the collected disease datasets and the code of extended SEIR model.
For 21 provinces in mainland China (Anhui, Chongqing, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Tianjin, Yunnan, Zhejiang), Hongkong, China and Singapore, we browsed all reports published on official websites of local health commissions, and extracted key individual information, such as travel history (depature date and return date), date of symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, confirmed, and isolation.
We also obtained the doubling time of confirmed cases in the 69 countries with no less than 180 cases by 25 March 2020 and uploaded this dataset.
The code of extended SEIR model is used to estimated the transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers at the beginning of the outbreak in China, and in the later stages of the 11 provinces in mainland China and Hong Kong.
